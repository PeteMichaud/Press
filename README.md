RubyPress
---------

RubyPress will be a fully featured blogging solution that is designed to replace Wordpress and was started as a test project where I could play with Ruby on Rails and learn it's ropes.  It's blossomed into something more.
My desire to do this stems from my wanting something that was 100% my very own from the ground up, not because I hate Wordpress or anything like that.  Wordpress is a great blogging solution, it's just not "mine".

I'm still very much kicking the tires and tweaking things to see what they do and as such this isn't a stable product yet.  But I have high hopes.

Please feel free to download, make comments and push back your results.. For right now, this is about my learning RoR, TwitterBootstrap, Devise, CanCan, Nokogiri..etc..



Intended Features
-----------------

  * Do everything in RubyPress that Wordpress can do -- It's a tall order.

  * Allow a post or page #show to define it's own layout.

  * There is no good reason a single taxonomy entry can't be multiple classifications with the same slug.. Fix this.  Wordpress did this wrong.
