What the heck is this?
----------------------

This project is meant to be a place for me to learn Ruby on Rails and the Twitter Bootstrap, nothing more.

It will likely never be a real product, just someplace for me to kick the tires, poke and prod and see what breaks.

Please feel free to download, make comments and push back your results.. This is about learning and I know very little about this right now.
